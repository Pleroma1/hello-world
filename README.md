"This is my first crack at Github, so I'm doing a tutorial"

I am a computer programmer, social theorist, innovator, and artist with a strong desire to create technologies that fundementally improve the workflow of primary human institutions. I am a student of humanity, robotics, and nature, and I hope to leave the virutal and physical world a better place than I found it. Thank you.
